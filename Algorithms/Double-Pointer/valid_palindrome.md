### Approach

The problem requires checking if a string is a palindrome after removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting to lowercase. The solution uses a two-pointer technique, moving inward from both ends of the string while skipping non-alphanumeric characters and comparing characters in a case-insensitive manner.

### Implementation Details

- **Data Structures Used**:
    - Primary data structure: String (input string)
    - Auxiliary data structures:
        - Two pointers (l and r) to track positions
        - Helper function alphaNum for character validation
- **Key Operations**:
    1. Initialize two pointers at the start and end of string
    2. Skip non-alphanumeric characters from both ends
    3. Compare characters in lowercase
    4. Move pointers inward until they meet

### Code Template
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPalindrome(string s) {
        int l = 0, r = s.length() - 1;

        while (l < r){
            while (l < r && !alphaNum(s[l])){
                l++;
            }

            while (r > l && !alphaNum(s[r])){
                r--;
            }

            if (tolower(s[l]) != tolower(s[r])){
                return false;
            }
            l++; r--;
        }
        return true;
    }

    bool alphaNum(char c) {
        return (c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z' || 
                c >= 'a' && c <= 'z' || 
                c >= '0' && c <= '9');
    }
};
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
    - Single pass through the string where n is string length
    - Each character is visited at most once
    - Inner while loops don't increase complexity as they're bounded by string length
    - tolower() operation is O(1)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
    - Only uses two pointers regardless of input size
    - No additional data structures created
    - All operations performed in-place

### Important Notes

- Key observations:
    - Non-alphanumeric characters should be ignored
    - Case-insensitive comparison required
    - Empty string is considered palindrome
- Potential pitfalls:
    - Forgetting to handle non-alphanumeric characters
    - Case sensitivity issues
    - Boundary conditions in the alphaNum function
- Common edge cases:
    - Empty string
    - String with only spaces or special characters
    - Single character
    - Mixed case string ("aA")
    - String with numbers

### Learning Highlights

- Key algorithms/techniques demonstrated:
    - Two-pointer technique
    - In-place string processing
    - Character validation
- Important C++ operations:
    - tolower() function for case conversion
    - Character comparison using ASCII values
    - String length() method
    - Character range checking
